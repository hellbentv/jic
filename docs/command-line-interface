jic CLI (Command Line Interface) Specification
----------------------------------------------

1. ABSTRACT

In order to help jic users learning its interface quickly and
successfully by reusing their existing experience with other engineering
tools, jic needs a well designed command line interface that is
intuitive to use.

Key qualities of desired CLI:

1.1. Well-thought-out structure of the command line

    All commands should be structured the same way, switches should have
    the same meaning for all commands (when applicable) and different
    functional segments should be grouped together for ease of use.

1.2. Support for terminal text attributes and colors

    When output goes to a terminal, user defined formatting should be
    supported (attributes and colors).

1.3. Well-thought-out use of pipes

    All commands besides their ability to work with terminals, should
    also be capable of both - receiving their input from and putting
    their output into shell pipes.

1.4. Well-thought-out use of command line completion

    All commands should be provided with proper command line completion
    for those shells that support this feature (bash is to start with).

1.5. A decent man page

    A decent CLI tool should have a decent man documentation.

This document describes such a CLI.


2. CLI STRUCTURE

The structure of command line corresponds to the commonly used one:

    $ jic <switches> [<subject_of_action>] [<command> [<args> ...]]

        where:

            <switches>
                are listed in a separate OPTIONS as well as for each
                command further below

            <subject_of_action>
                is one of the following (unambiguous shortened versions
                are also accepted):

                    <missing>   equals to "issue" subject of action

                    "comment"   for dealing with comments

                        <command> being one of (non-ambiguous shortened

    2.3.2. CREATE

    $ jic [issue] create <switches> [<issue_key_list>]

        Creates one or more issues as requested using the information
        provided by the means of:

            * interactive jicML editing (-e switch)

                A file with jicML representation of the issues is
                created and opened in the configured editor for
                editing, parsed and executed afterwards.

                Any valid fields/issues can be added into or deleted
                from the jicML file and desired issue field values
                provided - all the requested modifications will be
                performed in JIRA accordingly.

                If the file has not been changed or got truncated to
                zero length, no operations will be performed.

                If there were errors reported by JIRA when trying to
                apply the changes, an editor will be presented again
                with unsuccessful parts of the change decorated with
                inlined error messages to allow the user correcting
                those errors or canceling the remainder of the changes.

            * standard input

                - if "-t" switch is specified

                    Values are read from the standard input and assigned
                    to the issue fields according to the order of
                    mentioning of those fields in the template.

                    Data from the standard input is expected to be a
                    steam of valid jicML values delimited by new line
                    characters; an empty line is treated as a request to
                    not update the corresponding field.

                    If input provides less values than there are fields
                    in the template, all the remaining fields are left
                    intact.

                    If input provides more values than needed according
                    to the template, then all the extra values are
                    appended to the last field's value.

                    If input is a stream of jicML name:value pairs,
                    value assignment is done as in the case of none of
                    the switches specified.

                - if "-F" switch is specified

                    Values are read from the standard input and assigned
                    to the issue fields listed by this switch according
                    to the order of listing.

                    Data from the standard input is expected to be a
                    steam of valid jicML values delimited by new line
                    characters; an empty line is treated as a request
                    not to update the corresponding field.

                    If input provides less values than there are fields
                    listed for this switch, all the remaining fields are
                    assigned with the same value as the last one
                    received from the input.

                    If input provides more values than needed according
                    to the template, then all the extra values are
                    appended to the last field's value using space as a
                    delimiter when needed.

                    If input is a stream of jicML name:value pairs,
                    value assignment is done as in the case of none of
                    the switches specified.

                - if none of the above are specified

                    Fields and their respective values are read from the
                    standard input and assigned to corresponding issue
                    fields.

                    Data from the standard input is expected to be a
                    steam of valid jicML name:value pairs.

                If there were errors creating the issues in JIRA, the
                command prints out the error messages and returns an
                error code (TODO: specify).

                New issues have issue keys that are composed according
                to the following template:

                    <project_prefix>-NEW-<sequential_number>

                where

                    <project_prefix> is defined in JIRA when
                                     corresponding project gets created;
                                     it is take from the parent issue

                    <sequential_number> is a one-based counter for all
                                        the new issues defined in a
                                        single jicML data set

        Relevant switches:

            -d
            --down
                Use children of the parent issue specified by other
                means as parents for newly created issues; the number of
                issues created for each parent depends on the number of
                issue types specified using "-T" switch.

            -D <issue_key_list>
            --down-from <issue_key_list>
                Use children of the issues specified as parents
                for newly created issues; the number of issues created
                for each parent depends on the number of issue types
                specified using "-T" switch.

            -H <depth>
            --depth <depth>
                Process as many levels up or down as specified; zero corresponds
                only to the issue specified for -u or -d, immediate
                parent/children correspond to depth 1, etc.

            -e
            --editor
                Invoke an editor to interactively edit the jicML
                representation of the issues which is then parsed and
                executed.

                If the file is not modified or is empty, the operation
                is cancelled and no changes are made.

            -f <criteria_list>
            --filter <criterion>
                Use only the issues matching the criteria as parents
                for newly created issues; if multiple such switches are
                specified, those criteria are combined using logical
                "or" operation.

            -F <field_list>
            --fields <field_list>
                Edit only the issue fields specified.

                Overrides template (default one or the one specified
                explicitly using "-t" switch) if specified using -t
                switch.

            -k
            --keys
                Get issue keys for the issues to be processed using the
                same method (an editor or standard input) as the one
                used for getting all the other data for the operation.

                In this case all the non-empty lines of the input text
                until the first empty line are interpreted as containing
                a white-space or comma- separated issue keys; keys
                listed this way are appended to the keys specified by
                other means (arguments or switches).

            -L <link_type_list>
            --link-type <link_type_list>
                Link newly created issues to their respective parent
                issues using all the link types specified.

            -n <number>
            --number <number>
                Create <number> of issues of each type specified.

            -o
            --online
                Perform an online operation (create issues on the
                corresponding server as well as the local cache).

            -O
            --offline
                perform an offline operation (create issues in the local
                cache only)

            -S <server_name>
            --server <server_name>
                Use the JIRA server specified (or the corresponding
                cached information).

            -t <name>
            --template <name>
                Create issues according to the template specified.

            -T <issue_type_list>
            --issue-types <issue_type_list>
                Create as many new issues per each parent as the number
                of specified issues types - one for each. If this switch
                is not used, then the last one used for the same server
                is used again.

            -u <issue_key_list> --up <issue_key_list>
                Process ancestors of the issues specified; the issues
                specified is not processed (unless -s is also being
                used).

        Examples:

            # create two child issues of type "Sub-task" for CARD-100
            # using an editor, using the default link type to link newly
            # created issues to their parent and a default template
            $ jic create -e -T Sub-task -n 2 CARD-100

            # create child issues of type "Sub-task" one for each child
            # issue of the CARD-100 linking new issues to them  using
            # the link type specified while filling in only the Summary
            # field
            $ echo "Perform the preliminary research" | \
                jic create -d CARD-100 -H 1 -T Sub-task -L implements \
                    -F Summary

            # create two child issues of type "Sub-task" under the
            # CARD-100 using stdin to set their summaries
            $ echo -e "Do the first step\nDo the second step" | \
                jic create CARD-100 -T Sub-task -L implements -F Summary


    2.3.3. DELETE

        TODO: document

        Examples:

            # delete the issue specified
            $ jic issue delete CARD-100

            # delete a couple of issues
            $ jic delete CARD-100 CARD-101

            # delete all the issues who's keys are listed in a text file
            # this is an irreversible operation - be careful!
            $ jic delete -k < massacre-victims


    2.3.4. EDIT

    $ jic edit <switches> [<issue_key_list>]

        Edits one or more issues specified using the information
        provided by the means of:

            * file with jicML representation of the issues being edited
              opened in the configured editor for editing and parsed
              afterwards.

                Any valid fields/issues can be added into or deleted
                from the file and issue field values changed to have
                corresponding issues updated accordingly; in case if a
                new issue is added it will be created too (see the
                "issue create" command for details).

                If the file has not been changed or got truncated to
                zero length, no operations are performed.

                If there were errors reported by JIRA when trying to
                apply the changes, an editor is presented with inlined
                error messages to allow the user correcting those errors
                or canceling the erroneous bits of the change by not
                changing the file.

            * standard input

                - if "-t" switch is specified

                    Values are read from the standard input and assigned
                    to the issue fields according to the order of
                    mentioning of those fields in the template.

                    Data from the standard input is expected to be a
                    steam of valid jicML values delimited by new line
                    characters; an empty line is treated as a request to
                    not update the corresponding field.

                    If input provides less values than there are fields
                    in the template, all the remaining fields are left
                    intact.

                    If input provides more values than needed according
                    to the template, then all the extra values are
                    appended to the last field's value.

                    If input is a stream of jicML name:value pairs,
                    value assignment is done as in the case of none of
                    the switches specified.

                - if "-F" switch is specified

                    Values are read from the standard input and assigned
                    to the issue fields listed by this switch according
                    to the order of listing.

                    Data from the standard input is expected to be a
                    steam of valid jicML values delimited by new line
                    characters; an empty line is treated as a request
                    not to update the corresponding field.

                    If input provides less values than there are fields
                    listed for this switch, all the remaining fields are
                    assigned with the same value as the last one
                    received from the input.

                    If input provides more values than needed according
                    to the template, then all the extra values are
                    appended to the last field's value using space as a
                    delimiter when needed.

                    If input is a stream of jicML name:value pairs,
                    value assignment is done as in the case of none of
                    the switches specified.

                - if none of the above are specified

                    Fields and their respective values are read from the
                    standard input and assigned to corresponding issue
                    fields.

                    Data from the standard input is expected to be a
                    steam of valid jicML name:value pairs.

                If there were errors applying the changes in JIRA, the
                command prints out the error messages and returns an
                error code (TODO: specify).

        Relevant switches:

            -d <issue_key_list>
            --down <issue_key_list>
                Process children of the parent specified by <issue_key>;
                the issue specified is not processed.

            -H <depth>
            --depth <depth>
                Process as many levels up or down as specified; zero
                corresponds only to the issue specified for -u or -d,
                immediate parent/children correspond to depth 1, etc.

            -e
            --editor
                Invoke an editor to edit the issues specified according
                to the template (default one for the issue type or one
                specified explicitly using "-t" switch).

                If file is not modified or is empty, the operation is
                cancelled.

            -f <criteria>
            --filter <criteria>
                Show only issues matching the criteria; if multiple
                such switches specified, those criteria are combined
                using logical "or" operation.

                Parent and child issues around those issues which are
                not shown according to the criteria specified using this
                switch, are shown as connected (with an indication that
                there are skipped issues).

            -F <field_list>
            --fields <field_list>
                Edit only the issue fields specified.

                Overrides template (default or the one specified
                explicitly using "-t" switch) if specified.

            -k
            --keys
                Get issue keys to be processed using the same method
                (editor or standard input) as used for getting all the
                other data for the operation.

                In this case all the non-empty lines of the input until
                the first empty line are interpreted as containing a
                white-space or comma- separated issue keys; keys listed
                this way are appended to the keys specified by other
                means (arguments or switches).

            -o
            --online
                Perform an online operation (update the data on the
                corresponding server as well as the local cache).

            -O
            --offline
                Perform an offline operation (update the data in the
                local cache only).

            -S <server_name>
            --server <server_name>
                Use the JIRA server specified (or the corresponding
                cached information).

            -t <name>
            --template <name>
                Edit issues according to the template specified.

            -u <issue_key_list>
            --up <issue_key_list>
                Process ancestors of the issue specified by <issue_key>;
                the issue specified is not processed.

        Examples:

            # update two issues using an editor and a default template
            $ jic edit -e CARD-100 CARD-101

            # add FixVersion/s value for two cards using pipes
            # as only one value is provided (single line of text), it is

    2.3.8. LIST

    $ jic list <switches> [<issue_key_list>]

        Lists one or more issues specified.

        If there are no issue keys specified (either as <issue_key_list>
        argument or as switches) for the command, it shows nothing.

        Relevant switches:

            -d <issue_key_list>
            --down <issue_key_list>
                Process children of the parent specified by <issue_key>;

            -H <depth>
            --depth <depth>
                Process as many levels up or down as specified; zero
                corresponds only to the issue specified for -u or -d,
                immediate parent/children correspond to depth 1, etc.

            -e
                Invoke an editor to get (if none are provided) or edit
                and confirm the list of issue keys to process; operation
                is cancelled if the file is truncated to zero length.

            -f <criterion>
            --filter <criterion>
                Show only issues matching the criterion; if multiple
                such switches specified, those criteria are combined
                using logical "and" operation.

            -n <number>
            --number <number>
                List <number> of issues only.

            -o
            --online
                Perform an online operation (retrieve the data from the
                corresponding server).

            -O
            --offline
                Perform an offline operation (retrieve the data from the
                local cache only).

            -s
            --self
                Also include the issue mentioned for -u or -d.

            -S <server_name>
            --server <server_name>
                Use the JIRA server specified (or the corresponding
                cached information).

            -t <name>
            --template <name>
                Show issues according to the template specified.

            -u <issue_key_list>
            --up <issue_key_list>
                Process ancestors of the issue specified by <issue_key>;
                the issue specified is not processed.

        <issue_key_list>
            An optional comma- or space- separated list of issue keys;
            the output of this command is a combination of issues found
            according to the criteria specified by switches above and
            ones specified by this argument.

    2.3.15. SHOW

    $ jic show <switches> [<issue_key> [...]]

        Shows details for one or more issues specified.

        If <issue_key> equals to "-", standard input is used to get
        issue list to process (can be white-space- or comma- separated)
        until the EOF.

        If there are no issue keys specified (either as <issue_key_list>
        argument or as switches) for the command, it shows nothing.

        Relevant switches:

            -a
            --all
                Show all parts of the issues (all fields, links,
                comments, history); a synonym to "-p all".

            -d <issue_key_list>
            --down <issue_key_list>
                Process children of the parent specified by <issue_key>;

            -H <depth>
            --depth <depth>
                Process as many levels up or down as specified; zero
                corresponds only to the issue specified for -u or -d,
                immediate parent/children correspond to depth 1, etc.

            -e
            --editor
                Invoke an editor to get (if none are provided) or edit
                and confirm the list of issue keys to process; operation
                is cancelled if the file is truncated to zero length.

            -o
            --online
                Perform an online operation (retrieve the data from the
                corresponding server).

            -O
            --offline
                Perform an offline operation (retrieve the data from the
                local cache only).

            -p <comma-separated-part-list>
            --parts <comma-separated-part-list>
                Show all the parts mentioned, options are:
                    "all", "header", "fields", "comments", "history",
                    "links".

            -s
            --self
                Also include the issue mentioned for -u or -d.

            -S <server_name>
            --server <server_name>
                Use the JIRA server specified (or the corresponding
                cached information).

            -t <name>
            --template <name>
                Show issues according to the template specified.

            -u <issue_key_list>
            --up <issue_key_list>
                Process ancestors of the issue specified by <issue_key>;
                the issue specified is not processed.

        Examples:

    2.3.17. TREE

    $ jic tree <switches> [<issue_key_list>]

        Shows hierarchy that surrounds the issues specified.

        If there are no issue keys specified (either as <issue_key_list>
        argument or as switches) for the command, it shows nothing.

        Relevant switches:

            -d <issue_key_list>
            --down <issue_key_list>
                Process children of the parents specified.

            -H <depth>
            --depth <depth>
                Process as many levels up or down as specified; zero
                corresponds only to the issue specified for -u or -d,
                immediate parent/children correspond to depth 1, etc.

            -e
            --editor
                Invoke an editor to get (if none are provided) or edit
                and confirm the list of issue keys to process; operation
                is cancelled if the file is truncated to zero length.

            -f <criterion>
            --filter <criterion>
                Show only issues matching the criterion; if multiple
                such switches specified, those criteria are combined
                using logical "and" operation.

                Parent and child issues around those issues which are
                not shown (according to the criteria specified using
                this switch), still are shown as connected (with an
                indication that there are skipped issues).

            -o
            --online
                Perform an online operation (retrieve the data from the
                corresponding server).

            -O
            --offline
                Perform an offline operation (retrieve the data from the
                local cache only).

            -S <server_name>
            --server <server_name>
                Use the JIRA server specified (or the corresponding
                cached information).

            -t <name>
            --template <name>
                Show issues according to the template specified.

            -u <issue_key_list>
            --up <issue_key_list>
                Process ancestors of the issue specified.

        <issue_key_list>
            An optional comma- or space- separated list of issue keys;
            the output of this command is a combination of issues found
            according to the criteria specified by switches above and
            ones specified by this argument.

3. SWITCHES

    -a
    --all
        Show all parts of the issues (all fields, links, comments,
        history); might also be a synonym to "-p all" in some cases.

    -d
    --down
        Process children of the issues denoted by other means but not
        those issues themselves unless there is a "-s" switch specified.

        unless there are link types specified by the "-L" switch, all
        link types are included in the traversal operation.

        Down means the following for different link types:
        - implements: from the implemented issue to its implementors;
        - depends: from the dependee to its dependants;
        - clones: from the original to its clone.

            Examples:

                # list the CARD-100 issue and all its children
                $ jic list --self --down CARD-100

                # show all children for KEY-123 and KEY-124
                $ jic show -d KEY-123 KEY-124 -f "type=Sub-task"

    -D <issue_key_list>
    --down-from <issue_key_list>
        Process children of the parents specified by <issue_key_list>;
        the issue specified is not processed.

        <issue_key_list> is a comma-separated list of issue keys.

        Unless there are link types specified by the "-L" switch, all
        link types are included in the traversal operation.

        Down means the following for different link types:
        - implements: from the implemented issue to its implementors;
        - depends: from the dependee to its dependants;
        - clones: from the original to its clone.

            Examples:

                # list the CARD-100 issue and all its children
                $ jic list --self --down CARD-100

                # show all children for KEY-123 and KEY-124
                $ jic show -d KEY-123 KEY-124

    -e
    --editor
        Invoke an editor to get (if none are provided) or edit
        and confirm the list of issue keys to process; operation
        is cancelled if the file is truncated to zero length.

        Specific semantics of this action and type of the information
        that is being edited, as well as the reaction on all three
        outcomes of editing operation (those being: unmodified file,
        modified file, empty file) depend on the subject of action and
        an action - see those for details.

    -f <criterion>
    --filter <criteria_anded>
        Show only issues matching the criteria; if multiple such
        switches specified, those criteria are combined using logical
        "or" operation.

        <criteria_anded> is a coma-separated list of <criterion>, which
                         are combined using logical "and"

        Criterion:
            "<field><operation><value>"

            where
                <field> corresponds to JIRA field name
                <operation> is one of the:
                    "<"     for "less than",
                    "<="    for "less or equal than",
                    "="     for "equals",
                    ">"     for "more than",
                    ">="    for "more or equal than",
                    "!="    for "not equal",
                    "["     for "in the list", list follows with the
                            first symbol used as a delimiter; the list
                            may be closed by an optional "]" symbol
                    "]"     for "not in the list", list follows with the
                            first symbol used as a delimiter; the list
                            may be closed by an optional "[" symbol
                <value> is anything following the <operation> the end of
                        the string (with an exception of optional
                        trailing "]" and "[" if present)

            Examples:
                -f "assignee=some.user@some.host"
                -f "project=Some Project"
                -f "fixVersion[,2014.01,2014.02]"
                -f "assignee],someone@host,anotherone@host["

    -F <field_list>
    --fields <field_list>
        Process only the issue fields specified.

        Overrides template (default or the one specified explicitly
        using "-t" switch) if specified.

    -H <depth>
    --depth <depth>
        Process as many levels up or down as specified; zero corresponds
        only to the issue specified for -u/U or -d/D, immediate
        parent/children correspond to depth 1, etc.

            Example:
                -H 2
                --depth 1

    -i
    --interactive
        Perform operation interactively, confirming every step.

    -j
    --json
        Work with JSON representation of the data.

    -k
    --keys
        Get issue keys to be processed using the same method (editor or
        standard input) as used for getting all the other data for the
        operation.

    -L <link_type_list>
    --link-type <link_type_list>
        Provide one or more link types (as a comma-separated list) to
        work with; specifics of semantics of this switch depend on the
        specific subject of action and an action - see those for
        details.

    -m <message>
    --message <message>
        Provide a message that would be expected from the stdin
        otherwise; new lines can be added using "\n".

    -n <number>
    --number <number>
        Process as many items as specified (e.g. when creating issues).

    -o
    --online
        Perform an online operation (update the data on the
        corresponding server as well as the local cache).

    -O
    --offline
        Perform an offline operation (update the data in the local cache
        only).

    -p <comma-separated-part-list>
    --parts <comma-separated-part-list>
        Show all mentioned parts, options are:
            "all", "header", "fields", "comments", "history", "links".

    -P [<item_list>]
    --purge [<item_list>]
        Purge existing information and replace it with the one provided;
        specifics of semantics of this switch depend on specific subject
        of action and an action - see those for details.

        <item_list> is a comma-separated list if unique identifiers of
            the items to be purged; all items are purged if no argument
            is provided.

    -q <JQL_query>
    --query <JQL_query>
        Get the list of issues to process by performing the JQL
        specified.

    -Q
    --query-stdin
        Get the list of issues to process by performing the JQL
        provided in stdin.

    -r
    --raw
        Output raw results of the command; typically useful for using in
        automation; specifics of semantics of this switch depend on
        specific subject of action and an action - see those for
        details.

    -R <range_spec>
    --range <range_spec>
        Specifies which items from the result set should be processed;
        specifics of semantics of this switch depend on specific subject
        of action and an action - see those for details.

    -s
    --self
        Also include the issue mentioned for -u or -d.

    -S <server_name>

        cached information).

    -t <name>
    --template <name>
        Show issues according to the template specified.

        Templates are managed using template commands.

    -T <issue_type_list>
    --issue-types <issue_type_list>
        Provide one or more issue types (as a comma-separated list) to
        work with; specifics of semantics of this switch depend on the
        specific subject of action and an action - see those for
        details. If this switch is not used, then the last one used for
        the same server is used again.

    -u
    --up
        Process ancestors of the issues denoted by other means but not
        those issues themselves unless there is a "-s" switch specified.

        Unless there are link types specified by the "-L" switch, all
        link types are included in the traversal operation.

        Up means the following for different link types:
        - implements: from implementor to its implemented issue;
        - depends: from the dependant to its dependee;
        - clones: from the the clone to its original.

            Examples:

                # list the CARD-100 issue and all its ancestors
                $ jic list --self --up CARD-100

                # show all ancestors for KEY-123 and KEY-124
                $ jic show -u KEY-123 KEY-124

    -U <issue_key_list>
    --up-from <issue_key_list>
        Process ancestors of the issue specified by <issue_key_list>;
        the issue specified is not processed unless the "-s" switch is
        specified too.

        <issue_key_list> is a comma-separated list of issue keys

        Unless there are link types specified by the "-L" switch, all
        link types are included in the traversal operation.

        Up means the following for different link types:
        - implements: from implementor to its implemented issue;
        - depends: from the dependant to its dependee;
        - clones: from the the clone to its original.

            Examples:

                # list ancestors of the issue KEY-123 but not the issue
                $ jic list --up KEY-123

                # list ancestors for KEY-123 and KEY-124 together with
                # the issues
                $ jic list -s -u KEY-123,KEY-124

    -v
    --verbose
        Show verbose messages about the actions being performed.

    -V
    --version
        Show jic's version information.


4. jicML

jicML is a text based data markup language used to create and modify
JIRA issues. It is a lightweight, intuitive and fast to learn. It also
helps minimizing the amount of data duplication when editing multiple
issues.

    4.1. jicML representation of JIRA issues

    General structure of the jicML representation of JIRA issues has
    one optional leading section (shared fields) and repeated pair of
    sections (issue key and issue fields with their respective walues)

        -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------
        <shared fields and values>
        <issue key>                 # this and the next line can be repeated
        <issue fields and values>
        -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------

    where <* fields and values> are:

        <field_name>: <field value>

    where

        <field_name> is imposed by JIRA but in any case can't contain
                     the ":" symbol

        <field_value> is explained further below

    Having a <shared fields and values> allows setting the same value
    for a field in all the issues that have their keys mentioned further
    in the file. For example, if one would like to set the
    "FixVersion/s" and add the same comment for a set of known issues,
    besides performing other modifications that are unique for each
    issue, a jicML for such an editing operation might look like:

        -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------
        FixVersion/s: 2020.01
        Comment:
            Moving into the future as the whole team is having a long
            sabbatical leave.

        Issue: CARD-101
        Priority: Low

        Issue: CARD-102
        Labels: +MY_LABEL
        -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------

    All the fields and their values that are mentioned after an "Issue:"
    field and until the next "Issue:" field or the end of the data, are
    related to the issue which key was mentioned in the previous
    "Issue:" field. Thus, for the example jicML above, the issues
    mentioned in it would get the following updates:

        CARD-101
            FixVersion/s: 2020.01
            Comment:
                Moving into the future as the whole team is having a
                long sabbatical leave.
            Priority: Low

        CARD-102
            FixVersion/s: 2020.01
            Comment:
                Moving into the future as the whole team is having a
                long sabbatical leave.
            Labels: +MY_LABEL


    4.2. jicML values

    Values in jicML can be represented in three ways:

    - a simple single line of text

        The end of line character is denoting the end of line and is not
        included into the value; it is possible to add line breaks using
        "\n" combination though:

        examples:
        -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------
        Field: 12
        Another Field: Some text with spaces
        Yet Another Field: Some text with spaces\nand newlines
        And Yet Another Field: +A_VALUE
        -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------

    - a folded multi-line text

        This is similar folding used for long email headers as defined
        in  rfc2822 - a long sequence of characters (including
        whitespace) is folded with all but the first line having one or
        more spaces as their first symbols; when such a value is parsed,
        all the lines until the first one with non-whitespace first
        character are joined together using one space as a delimiter

        all the new line characters are treated as a whitespace within
        the folded value and are replaced with spaces

        Examples:
        -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------
        Field:
            12
        Another Field: Some text
            with spaces
        Yet Another Field:
            Some text with spaces\n
            and newlines\n
            consisting of three
            lines of text
        And Yet Another Field:
            +NEW_VALUE,
            +ANOTHER_NEW_VALUE,
            -OLD_VALUE
        -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------

    - a multi-line value within the "{{{" and "}}}" value markers

        In this case, anything that is located between the markers is
        treated as the value with just the following exceptions:

        If value starts with whitespace, such whitespace is stripped
        away - the following value

            -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------
            {{{
            Some text}}}
            -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------

        is equal to

            -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------
            {{{Some text}}}
            -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------

    A simple text will be parsed as a stream of jicML values - one per
    line - unless there are lines with leading spaces and some trailing
    non-whitespace characters, when value unfolding will be performing,
    consuming multiple whitespace prefixed lines into just one value


    4.3. Stream of jicML name:value pairs

    For the cases when jic is expecting the user to provide new values
    for the fields of the issues that are being created or edited, in
    some cases it expects a stream of jicML name:value pairs. The format
    of the stream is simple in this case:

        <field_name>: <field_value> <newline>
        ...

    EOF denotes the end of the data.

    Example:

            -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------
            Field name 1: This is a first textual value.
            Field name 2: This is a second textual value, which is quite long and
                is folded using leading space.
            Field name 3: {{{
            This is a third value,
            which is wrapped into the value markers
            and includes new line characters.}}}
            -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------


    4.4. Stream of jicML values

    For the cases when jic is expecting the user to provide new values
    for the fields of the issues that are being created or edited, in
    some cases it expects a stream of jicML values. The format of the
    stream is simple in this case:

        <field_value> <newline>
        ...

    EOF denotes the end of the data.

    Example:

            -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------
            This is a first textual value.
            This is a second textual value, which is quite long and
                is folded using leading space.
            {{{
            This is a third value,
            which is wrapped into the value markers
            and includes new line characters.}}}
            -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< -------- 8< --------

5. SHELL ENVIRONMENT INTEGRATION

    In order to provide more flexibility for its users jic also supports
    shell environment variables. Using specially named variables it is
    possible to provide values for jic options:

        JIC_O_<uppercase_name_of_the_option>

    Examples:

        $ JIC_O_FILTER="project=CARD" jic list -f "assignee=$me"


    It is also possible to provide field values for editing operations
    (creation, modification) through environment variables using the
    following name pattern:

        JIC_F_<uppercase_name_of_the_field>

    Please note, all the non-alphanumerical characters should be
    replaced with underscore characters ("_").

    Examples:

        $ JIC_F_REPORTER="another.person@host" jic create -e

    TODO: document


6. SHELL COMMAND LINE COMPLETION

    To allow a decent level of integration into the command shell, jic
    is providing few levels of command line completion:
        - subject of action completion;
        - action completion;
        - issue key completion (using the local cache and MRU list);
        - comment ID completion (using the local cache and MRU list);
        - issue and link type completion (using the local cache and MRU
          list);
        - list and template name completion.
